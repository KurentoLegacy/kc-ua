User Agent Test Plan

  	[<<Conventions>>]
	
		[<Automation>] Each test indicates if an automated procedure is in place.
		               Automated tests are JUnit based.
		  
		[<Pass criteria>] Pass criteria will provide a set of conditions to be 
	                      verified in order to declare the test passed. False 
	                      conditions will cause the test to be set as NOT PASSED.

* Register and Unregister

	User Agent (UA) must provide EndPoint registration.
	When the EndPoint (URI manager) is terminated, the contact
	must be automatically removed.
	
 	[<<Test Procedure>>]

		[<Step 1>] Request the UA to register a contact for a given URI.

		[<Step 2>] Terminate the EndPoint. This will cause
					the EndPoint to automatically unregister the URI

		[<Step 3>] Terminate again the EndPoint. No further
					unregister request are sent.

		[<Step 4>] Terminate the User Agent. No further
					unregister request are sent for the last unregistered EndPoint.
